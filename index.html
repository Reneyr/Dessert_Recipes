        <strong>Ice cream</strong> is a frozen dessert typically made from milk
        or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an
        alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such
        as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in
        addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point
        of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable
        ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured
        cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth,
        semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35
        °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.
        <br /><br />
        Ice cream may be served in dishes, eaten with a spoon, or licked from
        edible wafer ice cream cones held by the hands as finger food. Ice cream
        may be served with other desserts—such as cake or pie—or used as an
        ingredient in cold dishes—like ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes,
        and ice cream cakes—or in baked items such as Baked Alaska. <br /><br />
        Italian ice cream is gelato. Frozen custard is a type of rich ice cream.
        Soft serve is softer and is often served at amusement parks and
        fast-food restaurants in the United States. Ice creams made from cow's
        milk alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes
        (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut, almond milk, or tofu), are available for
        those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.
        Banana "nice cream"[a] is a 100% fruit-based vegan alternative. Frozen
        yoghurt, or "froyo", is similar to ice cream but uses yoghurt and can be
        lower in fat. Fruity sorbets or sherbets are not ice creams but are
        often available in ice cream shops. <br /><br />
        The meaning of the name ice cream varies from one country to another. In
        some countries, such as the United States, ice cream applies only to a
        specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of
        the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main
        ingredients, notably the amount of cream.[1] Products that do not meet
        the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled "frozen dairy
        dessert" instead.[2] In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina,
        one word is used for all variants.
